# Quadrat

Quadrat is a lightweight, browser-based tool for grid-based annotation of quadrat images.  
It provides a digital alternative to traditional field quadrats for quantifying plant cover and abundance from photographs.

The application runs entirely in the browser. No installation, sign-in, or server connection is required.

## Overview

Quadrat is designed to simplify image-based cover estimation while maintaining transparency and reproducibility. Images collected in the field can be re-analyzed at any time, and labeled datasets (including grid configuration and label metadata) can be exported as part of project documentation.

Quadrat does not replace field research. Images represent a static view of the system, and some organisms may be difficult to identify from photographs alone.

## Main Features

### Grid-Based Annotation
- Adjustable grid (rows and columns)
- Uniform grid across all images in a session
- Click-based cell classification
- One label per cell (mutually exclusive)

### Label Management
- Custom labels with user-defined colors and descriptions
- Prevention of duplicate label names (case-insensitive)
- Prevention of duplicate colors (exact match)

### Image Handling
- Multiple image session support
- Thumbnail navigation with previous/next controls
- Strict enforcement of consistent image dimensions within a session
- No image resizing or automatic scaling

### Session I/O
- Export session data as JSON
- Local-only processing (no data uploaded or shared)
